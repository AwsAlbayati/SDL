How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To bring the user vison and ideas into a program we most understand the general model of the project and then break down smaller ideas into written notes (user stories). It’s very important to gather all the requirements and specification needed and well documented them.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
In short, gather the requirements and specification base on the project model and break them down into feature. Most likely in my future projects I will use feature driven Agile software development process.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Build a good communication with co works, be collaborative and a good team player.
